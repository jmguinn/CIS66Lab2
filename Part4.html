    <u><h3>Hobbies</h3></u>
        <p><blockquote>What occupies my time while not in class or running errands are games. I've been playing simulation games for the last 13 years. It all started with The Sims that I recieved with my first computer. I was given the computer for educational purposes but I made it work. Computers sparked my interests over the years, I've decided to learn to code for possibly a career or maybe just for fun, depends how I feel at the end of the semester. I also do love to run, always hated it in a physical education class. I did decide my senior year of highschol to go out for track just for fun. Not being the fastest runner never bothered me, I was just there for the experience and even though it was grueling, I had a whole lot of fun. Another hobby of mine, I would say is cooking. I've always cooked ever since my guardian taught me a few tricks in the kitchen. Sure it may not be the fanciest dish but I <i>know</i> my way around a kitchen.</blockquote></p>
       <u><h3>Career Goals</h3></u>
        <p><blockquote>Oh, I've been <b>dreading</b> this section all my life. <s>At this point in life I should have a plan right?</s> What I mean is, a specific career still alludes me. I've thought this over and I just <em>cannot</em> see myself in a office typing away. I've always wanted to travel and I may do that. Do they have traveling coding positions? I can see myself doing that. Living my life on the road seeing the sites and yet on my off times making an income from coding something.</blockquote></p>
     <u><h3>Family</h3></u>
        <p><blockquote>I haven't always had the largest family. <s>My legal guardian Donna</s>(May she rest in peace) and also my sister Betsy. I do have  a biological mother, Lisa. I haven't seen her in the last ten years however. I was part of a foster family and I was adopted into it. From the outside, people would question if we were a family, even though we were not related, it was a family. An odd family, but an family nonetheless. At this point of time I do have a significant other who has a large family, and I'm still getting used to it.</blockquote></p>
    <u><h3>Everything Else</h3></u>
        <p><blockquote>So here it is, we come to a sad close. Well lets show some examples of other html tags that I may have not included at this point so far. Here is an example of the Abbreviation tag. <abbr title="Columbia Brodcasting System">CBS</abbr> has one of the most popular shows on TV today. An example of the definition tag, <dfn>Downtown</dfn> of, in, or characteristic of the central area or main business and commercial area of a town or city. For my last trick we'll talk about the <sup>SuperScript</sup> and <sub>SubScript</sub> tags. And well, on that bombshell goodnight.</blockquote></p>
